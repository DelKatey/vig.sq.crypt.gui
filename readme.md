## Introduction

This repository contains all the files needed to compile a working version of the **vigenere_square_cipher (GUI version)**.

If you're looking for the GUI version, this is not it. You can find that [here](https://github.com/DelKatey/vig.sq.crypt.gui).
If you're looking for the DLL version, this is also not it. You can find that [here](https://github.com/DelKatey/vig.sq.crypt.dll).

## Usage

Select either "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" in the options pane first. 
Enter the plaintext (if using Encrypt), or ciphertext (if using Decrypt) in the "Input" box. 
Supply the key for encrypting/decrypting in the "Key" box.
Click "Go", and you will get the result in the "Output" box.
	
## How this came to be

Out of boredom, I decided to implement what I learnt in a module of a course I was taking, in C#, and as a quick challenge to myself.

## Installation

This was coded with Visual Studio 2010, using .NET Framework 3.5, and should thus be usable with any version of Visual Studio 2010 and up, as well as SharpDevelop. Compatibility wise, it should present no challenges in being converted to use a newer version of the .NET Framework.
